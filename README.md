# kubernetes-ckad
This repo contains commands used in CKAD along with reference YAML files.

In Q4 2020, I studied for the Kubernetes Application Developer Certification, 
[following this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/). 

These are the notes I made about kubectl commands to run in the exam, along with template YAML files for pod, service, secrets 
and job defintions which I found useful whilst I was studying.
